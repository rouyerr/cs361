I have found two bugs with the API export of games.

The first is that when a game ends right after a capture of a unmoved rook, the ending FEN does not reflect the change in casting rights. Example in the API response from "https://api.chess.com/pub/player/remyrouyer/games/2022/01", if you search for the game with "url" == "https://www.chess.com/game/live/35153774899" (uuid:4a0f02c8-6e66-11ec-995d-78ac4409ff3c) the FEN given in both the pgn and the FEN is "B3kb1r/p2nqppp/3pb3/8/2p5/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB2RK1 b kq -". This is incorrect as is should be "B3kb1r/p2nqppp/3pb3/8/2p5/5Q1P/PPP2PP1/RNB2RK1 b k - 0 13", the queenside black rook was captured in the last move, so black loses queenside castling rights, this isn't reflected in the fen. However when exporting (sharing) the game from its url on the main website, it does correctly show the FEN.

The second relates to the first, I noticed with the API export, all the live games (but daily games work fine) are missing the halfmove clock and full move number part. Example 1, daily game with "uuid":"4a0adc38-6af7-11ec-8310-939f9e01000b" from that same API request correctly exports a fen the the halfmove clock and move numbers (last two numbers in fen) : "rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/4p3/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq e6 0 2". Example 2, in the same API request the game with "uuid":"dbaef0f9-6cdd-11ec-86bf-78ac4409ff3c" "1k4Q1/1pp5/p7/q4pPp/r6P/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR3R b - -" when the correct FEN should include the half move clock and move number => "1k4Q1/1pp5/p7/q4pPp/r6P/3P4/PPP2P2/2KR3R b - - 0 22". Another example is the first game I showed with the incorrect castling, it also did not include the move numebers.

Thank you and let me know if theres anything I can help with. Also tell Joe Bruin I said hi.
